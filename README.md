# Website

This website uses the theme from https://github.com/gauchm/modern-resume-theme (which is a fork of https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme).

## Running locally

Before you start make sure you have Ruby and the gems for Jekyll installed locally. You can find out how to do that [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

  1. `bundle install`
  2. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
  3. Open http://localhost:4000

Note: You will need to re-run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to see changes made in `_config.yml`.

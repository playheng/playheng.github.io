  Hi, I'm Martin. I work on the [Flood Forecasting Initiative at Google Research](https://sites.research.google/floodforecasting/) in Switzerland. Previously, I was a PhD student in [Sepp Hochreiter's group](https://ml-jku.github.io/) at Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria, a graduate computer science student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), Canada, and an undergraduate student at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu), Germany.
  
  My research is at the intersection of machine learning and hydrology. We focus on developing data-driven deep learning techniques for streamflow prediction. Visit our research blog at [neuralhydrology.github.io](https://neuralhydrology.github.io/) for more information on current and recent projects.

          After two exchange terms at the University of Waterloo, I decided to continue pursuing my Master's in Canada. This allowed me to do a lot more research throughout my degree. \\
          Supervised by Jimmy Lin, my research was on machine learning in hydrology.
          I developed neural and non-neural machine learning algorithms to predict streamflow from spatially and temporally distributed input data.
          A large part of this work was in collaboration with environmental scientists.

          I developed neural and non-neural machine learning algorithms to predict streamflow from spatially and temporally distributed input data. A large part of this work was in collaboration with environmental scientists.
          Besides, we worked with domain specialists from the environmental sciences on developing the [Cuizinart](https://tuna.cs.uwaterloo.ca/), a cloud-based interactive platform that allows researchers to "slice and dice" large environmental datasets.

          Besides my main research focus on machine learning during my graduate studies, I worked as a graduate research assistant. In collaboration with domain specialists from the environmental sciences, we developed the cloud-based [Cuizinart](https://tuna.cs.uwaterloo.ca/cuizinart) platform that provides access to large environmental datasets. 
          Also, we worked on solutions for metadata management in the [Global Water Futures](https://gwf.usask.ca/) program.

          In parallel to my studies in Karlsruhe, I worked part-time as a working student in the cloud HR software development at SAP SuccessFactors.
          As part of the Rules Engine scrum team, I worked on designing and developing a rules framework that enables users to customize automatic business processes in their HR system.
          My work involved Java programming as well as data analytics tasks, using Python, Jupyter notebooks, SQL, and Splunk.

          Between high school and university, I did a full-time internship in software development.
          I designed, developed, and tested on-premise HR software for the SAP ERP solution.
          My work mostly involved programming in ABAP. Also, I learned about SAP's ERP software and its customizing.
